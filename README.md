# Digital-PID
A digital pid controller made using real-time programming in C


## Objectives 
To design and implement a real-time digital PID controllers (basic and anti-windup) to control the position of a DC motor using concurrent programming with Pthreads.
### Part 1
* to design the PID controller using the Ultimate Sensitivity Method, and to develop and test the control program using simulation functions
### Part 2
* to extend the control program developed in Part A for real-time implementation on a real-time Linux operating system
### Part 3
* to further extend the functionality of the control program
